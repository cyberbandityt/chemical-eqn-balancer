# Sample execution of the program:

```
left hand side of the equation:
H2+O2
right hand side of the equation:
H2O

 THE BALANCED EQUATION IS:

2H2+O2  -->     2H2O
```

# This version VS the original one:

    >This version might run slower, but it can handle the reactions that come with elements inside parenthesis as well. Also, it only uses
    the libraries that come inside the Python standard library. It has one more disadvantage that needs to be taken account of, which is,
    it can only balance reactions that have integer coefficients.
